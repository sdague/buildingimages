# Building Container Images in IBM Cloud

content creation around image building for containers

# Prerequisites

Before you get started you'll need an IBM Cloud account and need to
install
the
[IBM Cloud Development Tools](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/ibm-cloud-developer-tools).

You should also clone
the [guestbook repository](https://github.com/IBM/guestbook) as all
image builds will be based on that.

Once those are installed, you'll be able to complete the commands
below.

# Basics of Image Building

Kubernetes uses standard container images to deploy applications.

From the application's perspective, a container image is a single
filesystem that is created before the application is started.

From a creation perspective, container images are layers. These layers
are built up using a `Dockerfile`. Lets look at the example guestbook
application `Dockerfile` and pull it apart.

```
FROM golang as builder
RUN go get github.com/codegangsta/negroni
RUN go get github.com/gorilla/mux github.com/xyproto/simpleredis
COPY main.go .
RUN go build main.go

FROM busybox:ubuntu-14.04

COPY --from=builder /go//main /app/guestbook

ADD public/index.html /app/public/index.html
ADD public/script.js /app/public/script.js
ADD public/style.css /app/public/style.css

WORKDIR /app
CMD ["./guestbook"]
EXPOSE 3000
```

A Dockerfile contains a set of image build directives, such as `COPY`
or `RUN`. When each directive is executed it creates a new layer in
the image repository. Future layers build on the ones before it. This
layered approach creates some efficiencies for storing and fetching
image content.

## Directives

Here is a brief overview of the directives used above.

`FROM` - pulls a layer from a remote repository. The default
repository is the docker image registry. A special form of `FROM` uses
the `as` keyword to create a named building space.

`RUN` - executes a command, all output files go into the layer. There
are a few `go get` commands that pull in libraries for the main
application. Later the main.go is compiled using this.

`COPY` - copy a file from the local filesystem into the container. This
can work on a set of files.

`WORKDIR` - like unix `cwd`, change the workding directory. The
impacts all future commands in the `Dockerfile`.

`CMD` - what command should be run in this container if no exec is
passed into it. `CMD` means that the command run is replaceable. There
is another stanza `ENTRYPOINT` which is not replaceable.

`EXPOSE` - open up a specific port from this container to the
infrastructure.

These commands, plus many more are documented on the [Docker reference
site](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd).

## What's going on

This example shows some of the more advanced methods in building an
image. One of the best practices is to ship artifacts and not build
environments. In this case there are two `FROM` stanzas.

```
FROM golang as builder
RUN go get github.com/codegangsta/negroni
RUN go get github.com/gorilla/mux github.com/xyproto/simpleredis
COPY main.go .
RUN go build main.go
```

This first import of the `golang` layer creates an environment that
can compile go code. It is named `builder` for reference later.

```
FROM busybox:ubuntu-14.04

COPY --from=builder /go//main /app/guestbook
```

Once that is compiled, a new base layer is referenced for a minimal
filesystem. The application is copied from the `builder` environment
into the primary environment. The net result is a very small image
with just the statically compiled go binary and some tools to help
with debugging later.

## Best Practices for Building Images

There are a number of best practices when building images.

### Ship artifacts not build environments

Whatever files are created in a layer are stored in the intermediate
layer. Sometimes what gets added in each layer ends up as a
surprise. For instance, when install Linux packages with `apt`, not
only is the software installed, but copies of the packages are stored
in `/var/cache/apt/archives`. This can add significant bloat to your
images, which slows down image upload/download times and thus
container start times.

When using standard install tools, be sure to include clean up
commands as part of the run command. For instance:

```
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip && apt-get clean
```

Which updates the repos, installs packages, and deletes downloaded
archive files.

# Publishing to IBM Cloud

You can build images with docker and publish them publicly to docker
hub. However, if you are going to be using these images inside of IBM
cloud it's best practice to publish them into the IBM Cloud Container
Registry. This makes the images much more network local to where they
run, and makes them private to your IBM Cloud account.

## Creating your registry

Before you can upload images to the IBM Cloud you must first create a
registry namespace. Namespaces are just used to help you organize your
account. You can have many namespaces in your account, creating one
per project is a useful way of staying organized.

```
> bx cr namespace-add guestbook
```

This will create a registry url of `registry.ng.bluemix.net/guestbook`
that you can use for uploading images.

## Building using bx client

The bx client can be used to build images in the IBM Cloud, without
needing to have docker installed locally. Authentication to the IBM
Cloud is handled by bx client.

It is important to provide a meaningful name for the image, and a
meaningful version.

```

OK
```

This builds and pushes all the relevant layers.

The `--tag` field gives the image a name and version, separated by the
`:`. The name includes the registry url.

The version is relatively free form. It should be something that is
meaningful to your time. The important thing is that tags do not get
reused. If you rebuild an image, make sure to change the version
before uploading. Many Kubernetes primitives, such as deployments,
will perform a graceful rolling upgrade when you specify a new image
version. If image versions get reused it hampers the effectiveness of
container orchestration systems.

# Retrieving from IBM Cloud

IBM Cloud images are referenced in kubernetes configuration by full
url. This url is the same as the `--tag` that was specified during
building.

```
apiVersion: apps/v1

  name: guestbook
  labels:
    app: guestbook
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:

        ports:
        - name: http-server
          containerPort: 3000
```

# Vulnerability Advisor

An additional feature of using the IBM Container Service is IBM
Vulnerabiliy Advisor. After the image is uploaded it is scanned by a
set of tools that look for common security issues. These scans are
also run regularly as new CVEs are issued.

In the case of the guestbook image it's an extremely small
microservice that doesn't include a traditional OS base, so there is
not much VA can do with it. If we look at a set of images that are
based on an Ubuntu Linux base we can see it in action.

```

We can drill down into an image in question:

```

This scans inside the image and found that the standard perl package
that was part of the base image has a security notice associated with
it, as well as the CVEs that references. Rebuilding this image with
updates applied would address this issue.

It also scans for potential configuration issues. The configuration
issues listed here aren't really applicable to this image as there is
no login services to the container.
